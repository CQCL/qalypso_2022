# Qermit Challenges

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07109 - This paper proposes a new approach to generating training data for CDR. This should not be too tricky and would adapt the implementation in Qermit, rather than requiring a new full scheme to be written.

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01157 - This is an approach to combining ZNE and CDR in a way that is more intelligent than running them back to back. This could probably use some of the MitTasks that exist in Qermit, but would also require some new ones, and would require for a new MitEx to be written.

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14329 - This is a post selection based error mitigation scheme. There is noting like this in Qermit at the moment, but it is conceptually quite simple so the attendees should be able to pick up the theory part quite quickly.

 - https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10811 - a neural network based approach. Again there is nothing like this in Qermit. In this case the theory part is a little more complicated.
